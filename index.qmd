I am a digital policy expert, specialised in digital rights and (open) data.

Currently, I am working at [Eurocities](https://eurocities.eu), the largest network of European cities, in the Digital Transformation team. I am in charge of advocacy, members relations, project management. The main areas of focus I work on are digital rights, also through the [Cities Coalition for Digital Rights](https://citiesfordigitalrights.org/), data, and interoperability, also through the [Living-in.EU](https://living-in.eu) project.

From 2020 to 2023 I worked in the Interministerial Directorate for Digital of the French government, the [Direction interministérielle du numérique](https://numerique.gouv.fr). Within the unit in charge of data, algorithms, and source code policy, I worked on [open data](https://data.gouv.fr). My job involved relations with public administrations, external stakeholders ([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/), [European Commission](https://data.europa.eu)), some transversal work with other teams ([api.gouv.fr](https://api.gouv.fr), [code.gouv.fr](https://code.gouv.fr), [beta.gouv.fr](https://beta.gouv.fr)), and giving [several speeches](talks).

During my studies, I was involved in local politics in Milan. I worked on several electoral campaigns, as assistant campaign manager, data analyst, or simply canvassing. I was also active in a local section of a political party, organising meetings and doing community outreach.

I hold a Master of Public Policy from [Sciences Po Paris](https://sciencespo.fr), a Bachelor of Science in International Politics and Government from [Bocconi University](https://unibocconi.it), and I also studied at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca) and at the [Polytechnic University of Milan](https://polimi.it).
