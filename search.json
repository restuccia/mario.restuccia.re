    "text": "I am a digital policy expert, specialised in digital rights and (open) data.\nCurrently, I am working at Eurocities, the largest network of European cities, in the Digital Transformation team. I am in charge of advocacy, members relations, project management. The main areas of focus I work on are digital rights, also through the Cities Coalition for Digital Rights, data, and interoperability, also through the Living-in.EU project.\nFrom 2020 to 2023 I worked in the Interministerial Directorate for Digital of the French government, the Direction interministérielle du numérique. Within the unit in charge of data, algorithms, and source code policy, I worked on open data. My job involved relations with public administrations, external stakeholders (OECD, European Commission), some transversal work with other teams (api.gouv.fr, code.gouv.fr, beta.gouv.fr), and giving several speeches.\nDuring my studies, I was involved in local politics in Milan. I worked on several electoral campaigns, as assistant campaign manager, data analyst, or simply canvassing. I was also active in a local section of a political party, organising meetings and doing community outreach.\nI hold a Master of Public Policy from Sciences Po Paris, a Bachelor of Science in International Politics and Government from Bocconi University, and I also studied at the University of Toronto and at the Polytechnic University of Milan.\n\nLanguages\n\nItalian - Native\nEnglish - Fluent\nFrench - Fluent\nSpanish - Intermediate\nRussian - Currently learning\nCatalan - Currently learning\n\n\n\nContact\nTo email me, take the URL of this website and replace the first dot with a @."
